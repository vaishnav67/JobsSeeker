# Employement Platform for College Students
### Why?
Nowadays it's hard for students to jobs as job platforms are filled with all types of people ranging from professionals to other newbies hence we have decided on creating a platform for specifically college students.
### Features of the Idea
* Students can upload their resume to generate points
* Students can check on jobs based on their strengths.
* Employers can review submissions and will have to give a reason for denial.
